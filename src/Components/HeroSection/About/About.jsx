          Hey there! üëã I'm Vikas Kumar, a final-year BCA student and an
          aspiring MERN Stack Developer who turned a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù
          tutorial into a full-blown coding obsession.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I spend most of my time building web apps, experimenting with frontend
          designs, and figuring out how to make backend stuff actually work.
          Sometimes it works, sometimes it breaks spectacularly, but I love
          every bit of the process.
        </p>

        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring new frameworks, solving
          coding challenges, or planning fun trips around North India. Oh, and I
          occasionally indulge in trying out fast food cafes or brainstorming
          startup ideas.
